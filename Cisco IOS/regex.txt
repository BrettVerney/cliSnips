# Used for: Common Regex patterns for searching and filtering Cisco IOS CLI output

show run | i ^interface|^_ip address
	# Shows all interfaces and their IP address information in an IOS style CLI formatReturns lines that being with 'interface' or  'ip address', essentially giving you all of your interface IPâ€™s in an IOS-pastable format.

show ip int brief | e unassigned
	# Shows all layer 3 capable interfaces on the device.
	
show ip int brief | exclude ^G
	# Show all interfaces that don't start with G (GigabitEthernet for example)
	
show ip int brief | include ^(G|I)
	# Shows all interfaces that start with a G or I (Show the Interface heading, and only include Gigabit Interfaces)

show int status | i Gi[1-8]/0/24
	# Shows the status of all port 24s on switches 1 through 8 in a multi chassis or stack setup

show int status | i Gi[127]/24
	# Shows the status of all port 24s in slots 1, 2, and 7 in a multi chassis or stack setup

show int status | i Gi3/0/(15|2[0-4])
	# Shows the status of ports 15 trhough 24 in switch 3 .

show interf status | i _15_
	# Shows all of the interfaces assigned to VLAN 15
	
show int | include ^[A-Z]|Last in
	# Best way to show the last time a frame entered an interface

show int status | i (a-half___a-10|a-half_____10|half_____10|a-full___a-10|full_____10|auto_____10|half_____100|a-half_____100)
	# Shows all interfaces currently operating at 10Mbps and/or Half-Duplex

sh int status | inc (.*not.*154.*)
	# Shows interfaces not connected and assigned to VLAN 154
	
sh int count err | e 0___________0___________0___________0__________0____________0|0__________0__________0___________0__________0__________0__________0
	# Show all interfaces that have had errors since the last reboot or interface counter reset

show cdp ne de | i -|e ID|Interface:|IP add|Plat
	# Summarise the cdp neighbor detail output
	
show lldp ne de | i is id|al In|em na|IP:|em De|rt De
	# Summarise the lldp neighbor detail output
