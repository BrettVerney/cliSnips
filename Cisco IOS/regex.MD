Shows all interfaces and their IP address information in an IOS style CLI formatReturns lines that being with 'interface' or  'ip address', essentially giving you all of your interface IPâ€™s in an IOS-pastable format.<br><br>

```show ip int brief | e unassigned```<br>
Shows all layer 3 capable interfaces on the device.<br><br>
	
```show ip int brief | exclude ^G```<br>
	Show all interfaces that don't start with G (GigabitEthernet for example)<br><br>
	
```show ip int brief | include ^(G|I)```<br>
	Shows all interfaces that start with a G or I (Show the Interface heading, and only include Gigabit Interfaces)<br><br>

```show int status | i Gi[1-8]/0/24```<br>
	Shows the status of all port 24s on switches 1 through 8 in a multi chassis or stack setup<br><br>

```show int status | i Gi[127]/24```<br>
	Shows the status of all port 24s in slots 1, 2, and 7 in a multi chassis or stack setup<br><br>

```show int status | i Gi3/0/(15|2[0-4])```<br>
	Shows the status of ports 15 trhough 24 in switch 3 .<br><br>

```show interf status | i _15_```<br>

```show int | include ^[A-Z]|Last in```<br>
	Best way to show the last time a frame entered an interface<br><br>

	Show all interfaces that have had errors since the last reboot or interface counter reset<br>

```show cdp ne de | i -|e ID|Interface:|IP add|Plat```<br><br>
	Summarise the cdp neighbor detail output<br>
	
```show lldp ne de | i is id|al In|em na|IP:|em De|rt De```<br>
	Summarise the lldp neighbor detail output<br><br>
